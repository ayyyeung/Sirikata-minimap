//This function demonstrates how to send messages.  You may
//need to read about repeating timers (examples/testRepeatingTimer.em)
//to understand what's going on.
//Essentially, this code broadcasts a message to all presences
//that this entity's presence can see.  The message contains
//two fields msg (with value "msg") and m (with value "random").

//Can ony really test this by running something that receives the
//message as well.  Check out testReceiveAllMessages.em and
//testReceiveMessage.em for files that will match the message
//that this code broadcasts.

//include the library containing repeating timer code.
system.require('std/core/repeatingTimer.em');

//first need to discover all presences that are around me
//will store all the ones that I find in the array arrayOfVisibles.

//tells the system that whenever a presence occupies
//even a really, really, really small portion of my screen
//it should notify me of that presence by calling proxAddedCallback.

//Every 7 seconds, call broadcastIt, which runs through the entire
//array of discovered presences nad sends them messages.
